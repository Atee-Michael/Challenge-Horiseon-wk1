# Challenge-Horiseon-wk1

## Description
This project focuses on an essential aspect of web development, ‘accessibility’. As part of the requirement, I was hired by a marketing agency to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. The scope of the project and its deliverables have been documented below.

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
